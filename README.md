# **GDSC DJSCE ML Workshop**

Welcome to the ML workshop organized by the Google Developer Student Clubs of DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering! This repository contains notebooks and resources to help you dive into the exciting world of Machine Learning using TensorFlow.

### Workshop Overview
This workshop is designed to introduce you to fundamental concepts and practical implementations in Machine Learning using TensorFlow. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience in ML, these notebooks will guide you through various topics to enhance your understanding and skills.

### Notebooks Included
1. **Introduction to TensorFlow**: Get started with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. Learn the basics of tensors, operations, and building simple neural networks.
   
2. **Gradient Descent**: Understand the cornerstone optimization algorithm used in training neural networks. Explore different variants of gradient descent and their implications in model convergence.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Delve into the world of CNNs, a class of deep neural networks commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. Learn how CNNs are structured and their applications in tasks like image classification.

4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Explore RNNs, a type of neural network designed to work with sequence data. Understand their architecture and applications in tasks such as text generation and sentiment analysis.

5. **Deployment and TensorBoard**: Learn about deploying machine learning models for production and monitoring their performance using TensorBoard. Understand the process of model deployment and how TensorBoard helps in visualizing and analyzing model metrics.
